	<h2>Budgeting For Your Vacation</h2>
	<p>There are many steps to planning a successful vacation, but most importantly you must establish some broad paramaters. For example, think about what you want to do (sightseeing, history buff, watersports, skiing, foodie, etc.) or where you want to go (mountains, beach, city, domestic, international) and it will become easier to attach figures to the itinerary and develop a strategy to pay for your trip.</p>
	<dl>
	<dt><strong>Tip #1</strong></dt>
	<dd>As mentioned earlier, envision your vacation. Determine an amount of time based on the ideas you have in mind. This process should also help you decide or obtain a general thought of where you should go.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Tip #2</strong></dt>
	<dd>Conduct some research such as using the internet to explore locations and activities associated with what you want to do.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Tip #3</strong></dt>
	<dd>Develop a draft itinerary for your vacation and be sure to include how many people are attending, the mode of travel, the dates of the trip and the specific agenda of what you would like to accomplish.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Tip #4</strong></dt>
	<dd>Initiate the basics of the budgetary process. Develop categories for the following items: transportation, lodging, food, excursions, shopping and miscellaneous.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Tip #5</strong></dt>
	<dd>Add values to your budget items by means of additional research and be sure to evaluate several options for each category. For example, compare the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Transportation (Air travel versus ground transportation versus ocean transit)</li>
				<li>Lodging (Hotels versus rental properties)</li>
				<li>Food (Purchasing your own food and cooking versus eating out)</li>
				<li>Excursions (Formal Tours versus do-it-yourself approach)</li>
				<li>Shopping (Quantity of souvenirs versus quality of a few unique items)</li>
			</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt><strong>Tip #6</strong></dt>
	<dd>Review the figures. Based upon the previous steps you should have dollar amounts for multiple versions of your vacation accounting for duration and the other options.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Tip #7</strong></dt>
	<dd>Determine if you have the means to pay for a version of the vacation that suits your needs.</dd><br>
	<dt><strong>Tip #8</strong></dt>
	<dd>If you are unable to pay for the vacation in its current state, begin to employ price reduction strategies to lower your overall cost. Listed below are several price reduction approaches:
	<ul>
		<li>Apply for travel related rewards programs (hotel, airlines, rental cars, and even some restaurants have reward programs which accrue points for the user based upon consumption...points can be redeemed for free or discounted services with the host company)</li><br>
		<li>Apply for credit cards or ATM cards which also employ an incentive usage/points program or have a travel-related bonus such as a free companion ticket over a periodic basis. Do not apply for a credt card if you're unable to meet mandatory payment obligations or if you are financially unstable in regard to using a credit card.</li><br>
		<li>Develop a savings strategy program for forgoing certain extracurricular activities such as movies, eating out, concerts, etc., in lieu of setting those funds aside on a monthly basis for the purpose of a vacation fund.</li><br>
		<li>Discuss and entertain bulk savings strategies such as using a tax refund, escrow surplus, employment bonus, etc., to make more significant strides towards meeting your budget.</li><br>
	</ul></div>
<p>If you are not making progress towards your goal, recalibrate your vacation by selecting different dates (off season), shorter duration, alternate location or considering an all-inclusive trip such as a cruise or resourt where that cruise or resort is the major focus of the vacation.  Belive in the value of vacations! View them as life changing experiences which create unforgettable memories for family and friends. Maintain a level of discipline in order to bring your dream to fruition and as a result this process will become easier and more rewarding over time.</p>
