<h2>Packing Tips</h2> 		
<p>Unless you're traveling to an extremly cold climate, you don't need a suitcase larger than 22" for a vacation lasting 1-2 weeks. The most popular sizes of carry-on luggage for U.S. domestic flights is 22" x 14" 9", or 45 linear inches. If luggage is limited and you do own suitcases larger than 22" then you should be able to pack for 2 people in that size and save on checked baggage fees. Below is an example of a 21" carry-on for a week long trip to a fall like climate.</p>

  <h2>Share Your Vacation</h2>
  <p>Our recommendation - don't share every highlight of your vacation while traveling. This is a red flag to anyone looking to commit a crime against you while you're away</p>
  <p>How should you share your vacation memories? Use technology such as your smartphone, a traditional camera or even an action camera such as GoPro to highlight your favorite moments. Check out the power of technology!</p>
